# Spotify API Assignment

Spotify has a wondeful public API. Lets explore API usage using music because music is awesome. Your task will be to explore some of the endpoints that Spotify offers us. You'll want the documentation:

[https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)

Outside of the documentation, which is expansive, spotify offers an 'api console' which will create requests on your behalf. It's a lot like Postman, check it out:

[https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/)

If you prefer to use Postman, you can! One of these tools will be useful. The nice thing about the Spotify Web Console is that it has a lot of human readable content to point you in the right direction. 

## Getting the Code to Run

Fork then clone this repository! Then, from the repo directory run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now navigate chrome to http://localhost:8000

Try a search for your favorite artist!

## Whats Going On

As a baseline, we're making a single request to the Spotify API. You can look at the code or the network tab to see the request being made, but the gist is that we request to:

```
https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=artist&q=WHATEVER YOU TYPE
```

Head over to the API docs for more about the search endpoint! [https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/)

We parse the results, and populate them into the results area. Simple as pie. 

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `displayAlbumsAndTracks`. Right now, when you click one of the results this function is called, but it simply prints to the console. This function should do 3 things:

1. Query the Spotify API for every album produced by the artist you clicked on. 
2. For each of those albums fetch every track on the album.
3. Display this information to the user such that:
	* Albums appear with its release date.
	* Each album has its tracks displayed before the next album appears. 
	* All of this information should be appended to this div: `<div id='albums-and-tracks'>`

This may seem simple, but it won't be. You will be using AJAX heavily; you will be parsing through some serious documentation; you will have to handle race conditions.  

__Bonus__ 

Get the tracks 'popularity' metric and show it side by side with the track name.

### Heres a Tip
You'll need to use these two endpoints, but you may also need to use more:

[https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-album/](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-album/)
[https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-artist-albums/](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-artist-albums/)
